# Work Day Scheduler

## Description

This aim of this project was to create a simple webpage that can be used as a schedule for the 9-5 work day. Each time block is interactive and allows the user to input the event/task which can be saved to local storage using the save button. On refresh, the saved events will be displayed and can be edited and re-saved. In order to make the page more dynamic, time blocks are colour coded to show if the time is in the past, present or future. 

This project helped me understand how to use JavaScript to store items in the browser's local storage which can then be accessed in order to display previous user inputs on the webpage. As well as this, I learnt to use the Moment.js library to display the current date and store the current time as a variable. This allowed me to affectively create a for loop that compared each time block to the current hour and added/removed classes to adjust the colouring of each block.
